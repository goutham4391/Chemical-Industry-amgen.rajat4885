<p>Clinical  trials are desperate for innovation. Speed and efficiency need to improve as  many patients cannot wait over a decade for new, potentially lifesaving  medicines, and trial participants often do not reflect the patient population.  Because clinical trials are complex and multidisciplinary, there is not a  single, simple solution for accelerating progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  this four-part series, host <a href="innovating-clinical-trials/rob-lenz.html">Rob Lenz</a>, senior vice president of Global  Development at Amgen, explores the latest approaches in clinical trial design  and execution and highlights real-world examples of how scientists can run  trials better and faster to develop potential new&nbsp;medicines that benefit  patients.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Episode 1: Operational Innovation</strong></p>
                <p>The  Scientist:  Welcome to Innovating  Clinical Trials, a special edition podcast series produced by <em>The  Scientist's</em> Creative Services Team.</p>
                <p>This  series is brought to you by Amgen, a pioneer in the science of using living  cells to make biologic medicines. They helped invent the processes and tools  that built the global biotech industry and have since reached millions of  patients suffering from serious illnesses around the world with their  medicines. </p>
                <p>Until recently, the model used for traditional randomized clinical  trials had not changed since it was first introduced in 1948. Now, transformation  is underway.&nbsp;Speed and efficiency need to improve  as many patients cannot wait over a decade for new, potentially lifesaving  medicines, and trial participants need to better reflect the whole patient  population. Because clinical trials are complex and multidisciplinary, there is  not a single, simple solution. What does innovation in  clinical trials look like?&nbsp;In this series, host Rob Lenz, Amgen's Senior  Vice President of Global Development and experts leading next-generation  clinical trials explore trends and drivers in design and execution to improve  trial quality and safety, decrease costs, and improve predictability,  reliability, and speed.  </p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Our understanding of human  biology and disease is progressing at an unprecedented pace, and clinical trial  development and execution needs to evolve just as quickly to deliver  potentially lifesaving medicines to patients who can't wait. We also need to  recruit underrepresented patients into trials, which requires us to think  differently about how we identify and recruit patients. In this episode, I talk  to Cynthia Verst, president of Design and  Delivery Innovation for Research &amp; Development Solutions at IQVIA, a global  provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research  services. We discuss the  drivers for applying innovation in the trial execution space and how the  clinical trials model is evolving across the industry thanks to modern  innovations.<strong> </strong></p>
                <p>Over the  last decade, there's been tremendous innovation in the clinical trials area,  including the use of things like trial simulations to optimize trial design and  improve efficiency, and advances in statistics and computing to support such  simulations. But there was relatively little new innovation in executing these  trials, including identifying potentially successful trial sites with  investigators and patient populations appropriate for a trial's needs.</p>
                <p>One part of trial execution is monitoring patient vital signs and  responses to treatments. Cyndi, will you compare and contrast the way we  traditionally monitor our clinical trials with the advancements that are  happening now, especially in the area of AI and machine learning, or AI/ML? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: Yesteryear, when we were conducting clinical  monitoring, we were sending clinical research associates at the investigator  site physically and compare the data that the investigator entered into the  electronic data capture system, otherwise known as EDC. The CRA, the clinical  research associate, would sit with the hard copies or the electronic files that  were blinded and do what's called a source data verification. So, what the  investigator entered into the EDC was the authentic data in the patient's hard  copy binder. It was then the CRA's individual responsibility to look at some of  the data trends and to ensure when they were writing this up in their  monitoring visit report, if they were seeing issues. We're leaving the impetus  on the human to find these signals and trends. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>As we're advancing, we're using more AI/ML and  more algorithmic predicting capabilities, where we're running in the background  in a blinded manner, where patients are de-identified, within the data of the  EDC, we're able to identify duplicate subject registration looking at their  clinical data, their lab data, etc. Also being able to look at trends over time  and identifying safety concerns, as an example with abnormal lab tests, where  we're not relying solely on humans. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>I'm not suggesting that the human on-site  visits will be obviated altogether. It's the human component being augmented  with machine learning capabilities that's helping to detect and respond very  quickly to ensure two things. We are in the eternal pursuit of ensuring patient  safety, first and foremost, and secondly, integrity of clinical data so that we  can draw the appropriate efficacy and safety conclusions. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>This is one of the rare instances where you  have all three levers being pulled in the same direction—that's improving  quality and patient safety, decreasing cost through the automation, and  increasing speed as one can interrogate these data literally real time, without  the need to send folks out on a plane to an investigative site. One approach  that's been getting a lot of attention is decentralized trials. We know that  about 70% of patients live more than two hours from a clinical site, making it  highly inconvenient or simply not feasible for them to make that commute  routinely. Unlike the traditional site-based trials that require participants  to regularly visit brick and mortar sites and have their assessments done there  on-site, decentralized trials bring the trial to the subject, say at their  home. There's a lot that's required to make such a fundamental shift in how  these trials are conducted. Share with us what some of those foundational  elements and differences are. </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: Decentralized clinical trials were being  developed and deployed prior to the pandemic. If it was not for these DCT  capabilities, we would have never conducted and completed the vaccine trials  when we did. I liken this to three major reasons why this will continue to be  the case of DCT helping us to accelerate clinical trials today and in the  future. The first is the digital technology components. That is the backbone  behind DCT, from everything we're doing in terms of accessing and recruiting  patients to conducting the trial and ensuring that we're collecting the right  data at the right time with the right quality. The digital technology component  is incredibly important. Being able to use digital footprints, digital journeys  with patients, meeting them where they are in the communities is of top  importance. Part two, to bring trial components to the patient's home. So,  those are services like phlebotomy—going and collecting blood samples—or  delivering investigational product to the patient's home or delivering follow  up and observational data collection via nurses or other staff at the patient's  home. The third pillar is strategic partners like pharmacy networks. Each  American is, on average, three to five miles away from a pharmacy. We see this  as another huge opportunity in offering decentralized trials and affording much  greater participation for diverse populations and underserved patient  populations.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>It's incredible just how rapidly the adoption  of these decentralized approaches have come into the clinical trial space. I  imagine it's going to continue to play an incredibly important role with the  end result of dramatically increasing the proportion of patients who can  participate in a trial. As we think about moving forward, one of the big  questions that the FDA has had is what do we think the durability of this will  be? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: The sustainability of those pandemic novel  trial executional capabilities is really on everyone's mind. I suspect the jury  is still out relative to data quality. It is going to be up to us, clinical  research organizations, industry associations demonstrating that, there is no  negative trend in terms of data quality. When we talk about DCT, we also have  to include connected devices, where there is that continuous stream of data, in  a way that's reducing burden on patients and sites, ensuring patient safety  along the way. Regulators are going to be a very important body that will  enable the sustainability of DCT.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>One other barrier that could preclude the use  of decentralized approaches, or virtualized clinical trials, is it's probably  not equally applicable to all diseases. When there's very little known about  the safety of a medicine or disease areas where the patients are particularly  sick, or those drugs may have particularly high risks in our patient  population, those may be ultimately less amenable to decentralized approaches.  But when we think about the vast majority of later phase large trials, it  certainly seems like those would be amenable to these types of approaches. </p>
                <p>One of the other advantages is to increase the participation in  underrepresented populations Are we seeing an actual increase in participation  from these underrepresented populations through these approaches, or is it just  simply too early to know? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: We're heading in the right direction, but I  think that we've got more work to do. In certain therapeutic areas, like  hepatitis, like HIV, we're seeing some movement in terms of beginning with what  I call diversity by design, and that that's something that we adopt here at  IQVIA. It's going to take the whole healthcare ecosystem leaning in here to  help with the building of trust and in the building of transparency. Designing  protocols as well as executional operational strategies, that's going to reduce  the burden, enhance, augment, and encourage participation from  under-representative, diverse, and inclusive populations. And then it's also how  we operationalize. We're going to need an investigator network that is  comprised of diverse investigators. Diverse operational clinical research  coordinators are more apt to recruit diverse patient populations. So, how do we  educate our investigators and ensure that we've got the ability to lean into  community grassroots efforts, that we are partnering with our patient advocacy  associations, that we are leaning into the industry associations? That's where  we'll begin to see the needle moving in terms of ensuring clinical have diverse  populations, epidemiologically speaking.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>One potential enabler of decentralized or  virtualized trials is the use of wearables or other passive data collection  mechanisms. There's definitely been some interesting advances in devices that  have received FDA approval for monitoring things like vital signs or heart  rhythm movement, or even glucose monitoring. Have these really transformed how  we're doing clinical trials? What do you think some of the barriers have been? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: We're already making dramatic improvement in  terms of reducing the patient-derived and investigator-derived burden of data  collection. Just five, seven years ago, we had investigator-derived data being  inputted to the tune of about 70% of data coming from clinical trials. And  we're now seeing that 70% being reduced down to 35% as a direct consequence of  connected devices, wearables, patches, etc. Passive data collection comes with  some terrific upsides, not only like DCT and risk-based monitoring, where we're  going to be able to increase the data quality, we're going to be able to do  this in more real time, affording the ability to track the data and sense and  respond if there is patient safety concerns. We've got some time before we see  a complete revolution because we'll always need the doctor in the equation.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>We have access to unprecedented amounts of data,  with clinical trial data through things like the TransCelerate Placebo Standard  of Care Sharing Initiative, which allows companies to share subject level data  from study participants who received placebo or standard of care, and real-world  data such as claims data or electronic health records data. Where do you see  some of the greatest potential and greatest applications of such datasets to  clinical trials? How are we using these large data sources to optimize the  clinical trial executional parts, particularly feasibility studies, where we  need to project if a clinical trial will be successful if it is conducted in a  certain geographical region, site, or with certain investigators? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: We're shifting the paradigm that we don't  conduct feasibility by firstly going to sites and saying, how many patients do  you have Dr. Smith that might be eligible for this protocol? We're moving  toward obviating that step to improve and accelerate timelines and accelerate  productivity. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Now,  another related area that we're seeing in terms of innovative trial designs, because  of the complexity of cell and gene therapy trials, we have some post-marketing  commitments that range from 10 to 15 years of long-term follow up. Conducting  those in a traditional clinical trial setting is simply cost prohibitive and  unduly burdensome for patients being able to follow patients in a more  simplified approach, whereby we're able to use the real-world claims data,  pharmacy data, hospital data sets, we're able to sense and respond and follow  those patients in a way that's meeting regulatory requirements as well as  satisfying long-term safety data collection.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>You mentioned enrollment is one of the one of  the areas that we're seeing the utilization of machine learning. Industry  metrics tell us that anywhere between 11% up to a third of sites never enroll a  single patient. The traditional approach, sending surveys out to potential site  participants, is simply very inefficient and terribly poor at predicting who  will be a good versus not a good enroller. One of the particular areas of focus  for us is using this data along with advanced predictive analytics, including  machine learning, to help us identify who will be those performing sites as  well as the nonperforming sites. The machine learning algorithms we build allow  us to look across thousands of attributes at a site simultaneously. So, things  like what their specific patient population is, what the trial complexity is,  requirement for genomic screening capabilities, etc. Do you see this movement  towards utilizing machine learning specifically in identifying high performing  sites as a broader trend or movement in industry? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: Absolutely, Rob. Over the last five and a  half years, we've been able to prove that through machine learning we're able  to connect that individual investigator with attributes such as their current  real-time eligible patient population, linking that to past and contemporaneous  clinical trial experience, quality of that experience, were they associated  with any critical or major audit findings, as well as looking at their clinical  trial landscape in their particular setting. We can take all those attributes  and running those predictive algorithms, we are able to sort investigators by  tier. We have statistically significant data suggesting that the engine is  properly predicting the top enrollers.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>What do you see is really transformative  opportunities that are not quite ready for primetime today, but maybe they will  be, say five years from now? </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: Using drug discovery AI/ML on the clinical  development side is going to move needles for us, being able to be more  predictive. For instance, biomarker identification, being able to precisely  identify and target patient phenotypes and genotype profiles, patient  segmentation and being able to target those populations more expeditiously. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>It's really impressive to see how much  innovation is being applied specifically in clinical trial executional aspects.  Cindy, it's been great and fun and educational for me. I've really enjoyed the  conversation. </p>
                <p><strong>Cyndi: Indeed, Rob, it's been a pleasure joining you  on this exciting topic. </strong></p>
                <p>The  Scientist: Thank you for listening to Innovating Clinical Trials, and thanks  again to Cynthia  Verst, president of Design and Delivery Innovation for Research &amp;  Development Solutions at IQVIA.

                <p>The  Scientist:  Welcome to Innovating  Clinical Trials, a special edition podcast series produced by <em>The  Scientist's</em> Creative Services Team.</p>
                <p>This  series is brought to you by Amgen, a pioneer in the science of using living  cells to make biologic medicines. They helped invent the processes and tools  that built the global biotech industry and have since reached millions of  patients suffering from serious illnesses around the world with their  medicines. </p>
                <p>Until recently the model used for traditional randomized clinical trials  had not changed since it was first introduced in 1948. &nbsp;Now,  transformation is well underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed  and efficiency need to improve as many patients cannot wait over a decade for  new, potentially lifesaving medicines, and trial participants often do not  reflect the patient population. Because clinical trials are complex and  multidisciplinary, there is not a single, simple solution. What does innovation in clinical trials look  like?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this series, host Rob Lenz, Amgen's Senior Vice  President, Global Development and experts leading next-generation clinical  trials explore trends and drivers in design and execution to improve trial  quality and safety, decrease costs and improve predictability, reliability and  speed.  </p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Randomized  clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of  medicines, but they come with many drawbacks including high monetary and time  costs, a lack of representation compared to the general public, and ethical  limitations. Historically, these trials were the main, and often, only  mechanism to understand the effects of a medicine. But more recently real-world  data, from sources such as electronic health records, or EHRs, insurance claims  and billing activities, disease registries, and wearable devices, is having a  greater impact on understanding  a medicines  usage and effects. Although this information is collected outside of clinical  trials, clinical researchers incorporate it during the earliest phases of  clinical development  to gain additional  information and speed up the drug development process.  In this episode, I talk to Brian Bradbury, vice  president of the Center for Observational Research at Amgen, about the increased utilization of real-world data and  its potential to revolutionize every stage of clinical research, from trial  design to regulatory requirements to outcomes measurement.<strong>  </strong><strong> </strong></p>
                <p>Hey,  Brian, thanks for joining me for this discussion on real-world data. I believe  we're in the midst of a transformation. One really exciting approach which is  underlying this transformation is real-world data. Brian, highlight the various  uses that you see for real data in drug development. </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: Real-world data is information on patients'  health status and/or healthcare delivery, as is routinely captured in a variety  of different sources. And real-world evidence is the evidence on the usage of medicines,  or their benefits and risks as derived from analysis of real-world data. That  spans a wide expanse in the clinical development and commercialization arena of  medicines. And there's a number of different dimensions by which real-world  data and real-world evidence are being used today. Certainly, in product  development, there's a large focus on understanding target diseases, natural  history, understanding where patients may exist. In the regulatory space, using  these data to inform on potential clinical programs, on getting medicines  approved through an accelerated approval pathway or label expansions. And in  the post-marketing safety arena, real-world evidence are also used to support  medical affairs research, where we're looking at the effectiveness of medicines  when they're administered in clinical practice, the evaluation of things such  as policy decisions, and the application of pharmacologic interventions in  clinical practice. And then finally, in the arena of value-based payment  decisions and payer discussions, we're really interested in understanding the  comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of medicines to inform on  payer needs. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>The focus on real-world data has been compelled  by the 21st Century Cures Act, which is designed to accelerate medical product  development. This requires the regulatory agencies to create a program  evaluating the use of real-world evidence, predominantly for two purposes:  One is to support a new application for an  approved drug, then second is to satisfy post-approval study requirements. Can  you share where you see the value of real-world evidence specifically from a  regulatory enablement perspective? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: 21st Century Cures was a huge step forward  for everyone. The idea being that we can use these data to inform on regulatory  decisions if those data are fit for purpose, the study design is well thought  through, and the analytics makes sense. Some of the places where we see this  really taking shape—in rare diseases and in the cancer space—we've seen the use  of external control arms to support accelerated approval of medicines, and a  number of medicines have gained accelerated approval through that mechanism. Here  are situations where you have a very high unmet need, potentially you have a new  medicine that is showing very significant clinical effectiveness, and you're  able to use an external comparator arm of patients with that target indication  to understand what the natural history or the true control experience for  patients with that disease looks like and compare that against the new medicine  that you're trying to bring forward. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>In clinical trials, participants are divided up  into different groups or arms. For example, a study may have an arm where  people receive the drug being tested, while others are randomly placed in a  placebo or comparator arm within that trial. There is now  consideration—particularly in rare diseases and late-line oncology trials—to  use external controls rather than within a trial comparator. What are some of the  analytic considerations in taking this step -- when you take a  placebo-controlled arm within a trial and replace it with an external or  synthetic comparator one composed of real-world evidence? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: When we think about a randomized control trial,  we think about bringing patients in all with a target indication and we  randomly allocate them to either get the new medicine that we're looking to  study, or we randomized them to some standard of care with placebo. When we do  a single arm study and we want to then compare it to an external population or  synthetic control, there's many, many considerations that we have to go  through. The first being, are we able to find patients who represent that  placebo-like experience in the real-world that we're going to feel comfortable  basing a comparison on? And that means, do we have the information on those  factors that are going to drive patient prognosis captured in a real-world  control arm or external comparator arm? We're always going to be concerned about  confounding are the patients materially different between those getting the new  medicine versus those in the experimental control population. Having those  important confounders, those factors that predict the prognosis of the patient,  that's critical whenever we consider these studies. The second piece is if we  have that information and we're able to then use statistical adjustment to  control for those differences between those patients, are we able to believe  that we don't really have residual uncertainty? Do we have the appropriate  endpoints in the real-world data that are comparable to the endpoints that are  measured in a clinical trial where you have very structured data collection? The  types of populations, are they comparable, such that if we then apply principal  analytics, we can get an answer that we believe is robust and is going to  enable regulators to make a decision about the effectiveness of this medicine?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Do you think we'll be able to migrate the value  of real-world data beyond that rare disease space or in the late-lines of  oncology, to disease areas where there are either no available therapies or  there are some ethical considerations and concerns around running placebo-controlled  trials? Given the progress that's been made, do you think using real-world data  is ready for primetime for more common diseases where there isn't an ethical limitation  to doing a placebo-controlled trial? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: There's a lot of work underway to test  whether in disease areas that are not significant unmet need, a sizable benefit  can be evaluated. If the magnitude of the benefit is not so profound, there  still will be some residual uncertainty. Under 21st Century Cures, the focus is  on label expansions, where you have evidence around a medicine, established  clinical trials, and now you may look to see whether you can use real-world  evidence to study the use of the medicine and an off-label indication in the real-world  and determine whether there's, in fact, benefit consistent with that which was  demonstrated in the original studies. There have been some recent examples  whereby folks have used real-world data and shown that the medicine's benefit  in new populations is consistent with what was seen in the original trials. But  there's a belief that, save a few specific kinds of examples, using a  randomized experiment still remains the gold standard for bringing this sort of  evidence to patients.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>You're referring to the randomized clinical  trial duplicate project. This is looking to if principle, non-randomized study  approaches using real data can consistently match the results of completed  trials. If they can replicate that, then that would give us confidence in using  real data approaches in lieu of randomized trials moving forward. There was a  publication last year in the journal <em>Circulation</em> and they presented the  results from the first 10 studies and show that eight out of the 10, the  estimate of the treatment effect was very similar, and six out of the 10  resulted in the same regulatory conclusion. What do you think the biggest  insights and takeaways are from that study? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: That team went through a process to identify  a number of clinical trials that potentially could be replicated using  available real-world evidence or real-world data. They did a fit for purpose  evaluation. Do the data coupled with the appropriate analytic methods and  analyses inform on a regulatory decision? Six out of the 10, there was  regulatory agreement between the clinical trials and the real-world evidence  studies that were emulations of the clinical trials. This study highlighted  that when we do that fit for purpose evaluation, we have clear understanding of  what we're trying to emulate in a real-world evidence study. That should give  us confidence as we move forward. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>It seems like certain disease indications would  be more amenable to this approach. Diseases where key outcome measures are  routinely captured in the claims databases, such as cardiovascular outcome,  stroke or myocardial infarction, revascularization procedures or  hospitalizations, or achieving a particular lab level that's captured in a  structured dataset. It may be more difficult with diseases where those outcomes  aren't routinely captured. For a lot of diseases we measure in clinical trials,  it would be a qualitative improvement or quantitative improvement or worsening  in the symptoms of the disease, something that's captured through a patient  reported outcome measure. There's been a fair amount of work trying to extract  data from the clinician notes, etc. Share a little bit on what progress is  being made there. </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: There's many other kinds of tests or assessments  of patients that are not either routinely done or the results of those tests  are not routinely captured. Think about measures of bone mineral disk density,  low density lipoproteins levels and labs are not routinely captured in all the  systems that we operate. When we talk about the work ahead of us, can we use  the extensive information captured in physician notes and electronic health  record systems across this country and beyond and make that information into  much more credible structured data. Here's where the use of AI and machine  learning and natural language processing, I think, is going to be very  promising. In the real-world data space, we see AI-assisted technologies  whereby we can use an AI platform that reads physician notes in a HIPAA  compliant way and is able to extract and validate markers of disease, tumor  staging information on tumor size, information on other markers of disease,  validating that against a traditional chart. Once we've done that, we build a  pathway to take that unstructured information, make it structured and combine  it with all of the other rich data that's captured in EHRs and claim systems to  make a more complete picture of the patient. The ability to bring that  information forward, make sure that it's trustworthy, and then integrate it  into these larger systems is going to really enable us to answer many more  questions using real-world evidence.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>There's no doubt that the COVID pandemic  catalyzed some pretty significant changes in how we conduct our clinical  trials. Things like decentralization of certain activities that instead of  being conducted at the study site could happen in the patient's home or in a  place that's just more convenient for the patient, direct to patient shipment  of study drug, just to name a few. And there's certainly been a lot of  attention paid to that in hopes of ensuring the durability of those approaches  in a post-COVID era. As you contemplate the COVID pandemic, where do you think real-world  data had the biggest impact? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: Two years ago, from a basic epidemiology  perspective, we needed to use a lot of the available information from real-world  data sources to understand who were the patients that were getting COVID. What  was the natural history of this disease? What were the medicines that were  being used by physicians across the United States and more broadly around the  world? We were able to use the rapidly accumulating data to inform on a lot of  questions. This pandemic was moving in an asynchronous way across the United  States and across the globe. There was a peak in one part of the world and then  it was flattened in another, and then a month or two later the peak was then  appearing in different parts of the world. This was very challenging to think  about how you could design studies. Where would the patients be that would be enrollable  into studies with the changing landscape of the standard of care? When we think  about designing clinical studies, we think about a standard of care that we  might use as a background, that we would then randomize to therapies, but that  standard of care was changing very rapidly, particularly as there were ideas  about repurposing of medicines that might prove beneficial. And the healthcare  community trying to figure out how to treat these patients and their prognosis.  Prognosis can be quite poor in many, many instances. So, there was this huge  dynamic piece of trying to design studies in the heart of this, and where I  think real-world data ultimately proved quite beneficial is that we can use  these large healthcare systems to begin to understand who the patients were  that were getting new therapies such as vaccines and understanding in large  populations who would have gotten the vaccine or didn't, their relative benefit  and the relative safety.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the major limitations of these  approaches that I often hear raised, especially as compared to a randomized  clinical trial, is that you can only establish an association. There are just  so many potential biases that limit the use to establish causation. These  biases are exactly what randomization in theory addresses in a randomized trial.  Could you share your perspective on that and speak to some of the analytic  approaches that are addressing the issues of bias. </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: We've done a really good job over the last 30  years of uncovering many of the sources of bias when we use real-world evidence  approaches. Early on, real-world evidence has been thought of as a data mining  exercise. You have a large data set, run some analytics, you get some answers.  There's been a growing recognition of the sources of bias, how they can arise,  and what are the things that we can do with appropriate research, design,  analytics, and analysis frameworks. When we randomize patients, we believe that  we balanced their clinical characteristics. All of the things that may be  prognostic in real-world evidence, we don't have the benefit of that random  allocation. We have the decision that the physician made about what medicine a  patient should get. And so, we ultimately have to figure out how to balance  patients in one treatment arm versus another. And that's largely done by things  such as propensity scores where we understand the propensity of a patient to  get one treatment versus another. But it also requires that we have the data on  cardiovascular disease history, blood pressure measurements, or the stage of  their disease. If we have that information, we're able to apply and deliver  evidence that is going to be much more credible. The other thing that is more  common today is quantitative bias analysis, where we are empirically testing  the biases that we think exist in our data. By doing that, we get a better  understanding of how strongly we can stand behind our estimates. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the other areas that I hear discussed in  terms of opportunities for improvement is data standardization. In the clinical  trial space, we have data standards, which most clinical researchers adhere to,  and this has really been critical for regulatory authorities around the world. What's  going on in the real-world evidence space? What will be needed to get us to a  point where we'll have regulatory-grade standardized data? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: The success of real-world evidence is going  to be based in large part on the quality of the data. Recently, the regulators  released a number of guidance documents; they're really focused on data  quality. We know that there's lots of different sources of data, and having a  better understanding of the provenance of the data, the reliability of the  data, the transformations that are made to the data before they come into an  analytic dataset that we might use to answer a specific question, the whole  effort now on the regulatory side, the process is being much more standardized,  there's more transparency about how that's occurring, and the quality standards  are being elevated, such that the end game is datasets that are much richer. They're  much more trustworthy and we're more confident that we don't have this big  missingness in the data that would undermine our ability to make a decision. The  last piece is, think about the work that's going to be done around information  such as omics and biomarkers. A whole new era is going to be coming forward  with precision medicine-like information being integrated into commonly  available data systems across the globe. So, I see that there's going to be a  real rich fabric of data that's going to provide a longitudinal record, and  that's going to require a great deal more standardization. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Brian, look into your crystal ball. Let's say  you and I connect again about five years from now. What are the things that  we're going to discuss then that we didn't cover today? </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: We're moving into an era where we're going to  be able to deliver evidence across multiple jurisdictions, hopefully  simultaneously. Can we study the natural history of disease in 10 countries  simultaneously? Can we understand the effectiveness of a new medicine in five countries  at the same time using principle design methods because we have  interoperability of the data systems, we have interoperability of the analytic  approaches, we have a common understanding of the strengths of those data, and  we have the ability to prosecute analyses in a near real time to deliver  evidence to assist decision-making by folks across the healthcare ecosystem? Understanding  the safety of a medicine when it's administered to hundreds of thousands of  citizens in multiple jurisdictions, that that will be an enormous step forward  for us as a global society. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Brian, I certainly share your enthusiasm for  what the future holds with increased utilization of real-world data. There are  certainly some areas where some work still remains, but you've highlighted just  how transformative real-world data is already today and will continue to be in  drug development. Thanks for sharing all your great insights in this exciting  area. </p>
                <p><strong>Brian: Well, thank you, Rob. I appreciate it. And I  share your enthusiasm and I look forward to a return engagement.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Five years.</p>
                <p>The Scientist:  Thank you for listening to Innovating Clinical Trials, and thanks again to Brian Bradbury, vice  president of the Center for Observational Research at Amgen. To dive  further into this topic, please join Amgen scientists at the Innovating  Clinical Trials Q&amp;A webinar discussion on September 28, 2022. Register for  the event at the link provided in the episode notes. <br>
                  To provide  the best care possible, doctors must prescribe medicines that they know will  work for their patients. However, most treatments are tested in clinical trials  composed of participants not representative of the general population. In the  next episode of Innovating Clinical Trials, we'll talk with Ponda  Motsepe-Ditshego, vice president and Global Medical Therapeutic Area head in  General Medicine at Amgen about engaging underrepresented populations in  clinical trials.

                <p><strong>Episode 3: The Right Patients</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The  Scientist:</strong>  Welcome to Innovating Clinical Trials, a  special edition podcast series produced by <em>The Scientist's</em> Creative  Services Team.</p>
                <p>This  series is brought to you by Amgen, a pioneer in the science of using living  cells to make biologic medicines. They helped invent the processes and tools  that built the global biotech industry and have since reached millions of  patients suffering from serious illnesses around the world with their  medicines. </p>

In this series, host Rob Lenz, Amgen's Senior Vice  President, Global Development and experts new explore trends and drivers in  design and execution to improve trial quality and safety, decrease costs and  improve predictability, reliability and speed.  </p>
                <p><strong>Rob</strong>: The questions scientists face in clinical  development are very similar to the questions that doctors face when treating  patients. Patients want to know whether their disease is going to go away or  worsen and whether they will benefit from a therapy. Doctors generally can only  share with the patient what the typical or average effect of a medicine is, but  they cannot specifically address the potential benefit or harm in that specific  patient. With advances in genetics and other human data, researchers and doctors  will one day be able to practice truly precision medicine. This inability to  predict how a patient will respond to a medicine is even more challenging in  under-represented patients because we often don't have the information because  they were not included in the clinical trials. This is due in part to systemic  issues that deter people from participating in research, especially those who  have been historically excluded due to factors such as race, ethnicity, sex, and  age. In this  episode, I talk to Dr. Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, vice president and Global  Medical Therapeutic Area head in General Medicine at Amgen, about the  recognized differences in disease incidence among racial and ethnic groups and new  approaches to increase representation in clinical trials.  The benefits are myriad, for patients and for  drug developers. Many of us view the inclusion of under-represented patients in  our trials as not only a scientific necessity but an ethical imperative. <strong> </strong> <br>
                Can you share a little bit of your background as a medical doctor,  and how that shaped your work and commitment to improving diversity and  representation in clinical trials? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: Sure, thanks, Rob. I am an MD qualified in  South Africa, and I've lived and worked on three continents and in four  different countries throughout my time in industry as well as a clinical  practitioner. As a native of South Africa and a black woman who's now living in  the US, I've really witnessed firsthand how equality and equity hasn't always  been present for a lot of people. And disparities in health are a major example  of this, especially for chronic diseases. This persists among different  communities, which really highlights that health equity is a global issue. At  Amgen, I love working as the global vice president of the general medicine  therapeutic area where I oversee work done in cardiovascular disease, lupus,  obesity, osteoporosis, among others, where we often see racial and ethnic  disparities in incidence and prevalence of diseases. But most importantly, I'm  also really excited about the work that I'm leading with our team called RISE,  which stands for representation in clinical research. This team is dedicated to  improving diversity and representation of participants in our clinical trials,  especially for those who've been historically excluded from research. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Since the inception of the modern clinical  trial around 70 years ago, the general approach has been to study a drug in a  relatively small but very homogeneous population of patients with a particular  disease to get a very precise estimate of the treatment effect, the efficacy,  as well as the safety in that discrete population, and then make basically a  giant leap of faith assumption, which is that the medicine will behave the same  in other populations that weren't included in that trial. So, generalizing the  results to patients of different age, or genders, or ethnic groups, but we now  know that's not always true. I was fortunate to have been trained by Elijah  Saunders, who, in addition to being the first black cardiologist to practice in  the state of Maryland, was a visionary in identifying differences in treatment  responses in black versus non-black individuals. He taught me very early on in  medical school that black patients respond differently to the various  antihypertensive medicines that were available. Fast forward 30 years to today  and we still find ourselves in this reality, where more times than not we're  missing critical information on the safety and the efficacy of medicines in  these underrepresented populations. In 2018, the Census Bureau populations  estimates reported that non-Hispanic white Americans represent about 61% of the  US population, but they comprise more than 90% of the population in clinical  trials. Ponda, can you give us a bit of an overview of how did we get here? Why  do clinical trials continue to have a diversity and representation problem? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: The first one is that there have been several  historic events in many countries, including the US, that have really shaped  the relationship communities of color have with medical research, as well as  the healthcare system. That's led to, unfortunately, quite a lasting mistrust  of both systems and has impacted how they approach the healthcare system. I  think institutional and structural racism, both explicit and implicit, is a  huge factor. We know that biases among healthcare providers lead them to  overestimate sometimes level of distrust of the medical system by people of  color, and that leads them to communicate less with their patients from those  communities about participating in clinical trials. There are institutional  biases that can also lead to study designs and eligibility criteria that  disproportionately exclude people of color. So, there's multiple things and as  well as lack of trial availability at hospital systems where people of color  get their care, there's often lack of community engagement. All of these  factors, in my opinion, have led to less participation in clinical trials. This  is why it's so critical to address social determinants of health, which  includes factors like racism, socioeconomic status, education, and the environment  when we address health disparities. We know that social and economic factors  drive an estimate of 40% of health outcomes; this is twice as influential as  factors related to clinical care. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>I might just add one additional to the list  that you highlighted. Oftentimes, we lack the epidemiologic data of diseases to  understand if there's differences in those diseases in certain populations. And  we certainly very often lack the biological understanding as to whether there  are differences in, say, how a black patient versus a Caucasian patient might  be expected to respond to therapy. For instance, are there different biological  or genetic underpinnings of the disease in different populations? What are some  of the things that are happening across the clinical trial ecosystem to address  some of these foundational problems? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: There's a strong acknowledgement that this is  a topic that must be addressed with a sense of urgency, and I believe there's a  strong desire to work together as industry or the entire healthcare ecosystem  to address the health inequity that we're seeing. We're starting to make really  great strides. What I'm seeing is industry striving to partner with more clinical  trial investigators. I see some initiatives to bring awareness to disparities  in health and what we can do about them. I see many peer companies serving on  multiple cross-industry collaborations with other sponsor companies that also  include patients, providers, payers, legislators, manufacturers, academia, and  others, to really find impactful sustainable solutions to address these  healthcare disparities. The other thing that we're doing that's really  important is supporting STEM education for underserved communities. Championing  the work of organizations who are already invested in addressing social  determinants of health, including community organizations, minority-serving  institutions like historically black colleges and universities. And maybe one  would argue that what happened with COVID-19, particularly to communities of  color, underrepresented communities, has really sparked the need to, first of  all, have these conversations cross-industry and be really clear that this work  is mission critical and it's time to move the needle now. We now created a team  called RISE, which grew out of grassroots efforts of like-minded Amgen  colleagues under the umbrella of an employee resource group called ABEN, which  stands for Amgen's Black Employee Network. We took a group of cross-functional  experts who had a passion for change and an employee resource group that  incubated an idea to become a reality. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>You made it clear that this is going to require  a comprehensive approach and will certainly require tremendous effort. With the  risk of sounding overly daunting, are there particular diseases one could focus  on that are disproportionately impacting minority communities? Where do you  think that a particular focus could have a positive impact? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: Cardiovascular disease is one area that we  should focus on. We know that nearly half of all American men and women have  some form of heart disease, but black Americans are 32% more likely to die from  cardiovascular disease. There's clearly a need to make a difference in this  patient population. The other population I would think of is diabetes, which  has a very close link to cardiovascular disease. 13% of the general adult  population in the US have diabetes. We know that American Indian or Alaska,  Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people are all at much higher risk of  developing diabetes than white populations in the United States. Their rate is  significantly higher, it's almost 15% And then also autoimmune disease, Rob. More  than 7% of Americans suffer from some type of autoimmune disease. If we look at  lupus, we know that the prevalence varies from about 20 to 150 cases per  100,000, and there's higher rates in minority populations such as black,  Hispanic and Asians. We also know that systemic lupus erythematous  disproportionately affects women of childbearing age, with a higher incidence  in black versus white females. So, again, racial and ethnic minorities are at  higher risk for developing this disease. Asthma is another condition. 8.3% of  Americans have asthma, but we know that black and African Americans as well as  Hispanics have two times more of a likelihood to suffer from severe asthma, and  black Americans are three times more likely to die from asthma. And then if you  factor in sex, black women have an even higher rate. When it comes to cancer,  among males, incidence and death rates are higher among non-Hispanic blacks  than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined. Black or African Americans  are twice as likely as white Americans to develop multiple myeloma. These  conditions that I've just is where we should be focusing on because we need to  ensure that the medicines we develop are based on clinical research populations  that are proportional to the real world setting, and that we're creating  solutions to health inequities with the needs of patients and their communities  at the very center of everything that we do.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>We're in an era of unprecedented access to data  and advanced analytics. How can we use more comprehensively various human data  to inform us in how we develop our therapy, due to things like identifying  patients to potentially participate in clinical trials, to those that are most  likely to respond to our therapies and derive benefit? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: We can ensure that we have access to consistent,  current patient demographic data via collaborations and partnerships with key  organizations working to improve study feasibility and landscaping processes,  so that the data is collected and analyzed with racial and ethnic  considerations by default. The other thing is, encouraging the diversification  and greater inclusiveness of biobanks, which eventually informs a wide range of  research with their samples and data. But unfortunately, we know that they have  historically been excluded from multiple communities, including racial and  ethnic minority groups. So, there's an opportunity for us to continue to  increase our diversity in terms of our biobanks and genomic research. The other  thing is identifying clinical trials sites that have high potential capacity to  enroll patients from our target racial and ethnic minority communities and  finding the clinical trial investigators who are like-minded as well.  Collecting not just disease descriptors, but genetic data can also help  identify new patients. And we're looking at using different types of omics to  identify those potentially new targets.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Yeah, I think there's also a potential  opportunity once one collects the phenotypic and the genomic data to  potentially identify new targets for disease. By increasing the diversity of  the populations that we study, almost certainly there'll be identification of  increased genetic diversity underlying the diseases, so another real  opportunity for target identification. </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: Absolutely.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>You mentioned the prevalence of cardiovascular  disease in African Americans. One of the emerging risk factors in  atherosclerotic heart disease is a lipoprotein called Lp(a), which is a  relatively well-studied subspecies of LDL cholesterol. And it's an interesting  risk factor because one's levels are almost entirely genetically determined.  So, your diet, your lifestyle, things like exercise really have little to no  impact on levels of Lp(a), and we don't have any therapies today that address  this. One thing that's been interesting is that the studies that we do have  pretty consistently shown race-based differences. Curious to get your thoughts  around what you think the significance of this is as it relates to developing a  potential therapeutic. </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: I think it's absolutely significant and  absolutely important. The risk factors that contribute to this, from what we're  seeing and understanding, disproportionately higher in African Americans and  probably even in women. 1.4 billion people globally have elevated Lp(a) levels  of more than 50. And we know that elevated Lp(a), as you mentioned, is  associated with various disease states, including coronary heart disease,  peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and heart failure. There are differences  in expression among people of different races. African as well as South Asian  individuals generally have a higher level of Lp(a). I think it's really  critical that we continue to study Lp(a)-lowering therapies especially in a  racially and ethnically representative population of patients to ensure that  we're truly collecting a complete profile of safety and efficacy data in this  population. It's incumbent on society to understand this predominantly  controlled by genetics Lp(a) has a disproportionate higher incidence within  African Americans and South Asians. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>It's interesting that African and South Asian  individuals have on average higher levels of Lp(a), but we don't understand yet  whether or not that confers a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular  disease. It's an important question that can be addressed in part through  things like observational studies that can attempt to understand initially the  association between Lp(a) and risk in the African populations, and then try to  attribute some causal association there as well. These types of dedicated studies  within the underrepresented populations in particular are really critical to  gaining that foundational understanding of diseases and then linking the  underlying biology to diseases in in more diverse population. So, we can  be armed with those insights going into our interventional trials, rather than  historically what we've done is either going blind or simply don't collect  sufficient information within the actual clinical trial to assess this  population. Maybe we can get your thoughts on what role the biopharmaceutical  industry has here. Do you think that we, as an industry, have an important  role? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: We are part of this ecosystem and we have a  very important role to play. There's a couple of things that we are starting to  do to address this. Working to identify diverse investigators and collaborating  with those who serve diverse patients, that is a big issue. There are  opportunities to work across the different stakeholders within the industry.  One of the things that I've also seen is a huge opportunity for collaborating  with non-profits in communities that can help remove those barriers to  participation in clinical trials. There is a long history of working with our  communities to address mistrust. At Amgen, we've focused on improving patient  enrollment and retention and with minority participation in oncology trials. As  an industry, we could look at partnering with influential community leaders to  address the issue of regaining trust. Communication and information sharing are  really fundamental to driving change. We have to do this with humility and  community collaboration. I really believe that it's the key to genuine impact  and sustainability. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>The notion of lack of trust seems very  foundational. What are some of those intermediate signals that we're making  progress there? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: We have community advisory boards providing a  platform where you have members of the community—patients, healthcare  professionals, different stakeholders—being able to sit and have a conversation  where they're being heard. That's been a very big and humbling experience. I  don't think we'll be able to overcome the issue of mistrust overnight, but by  having these opportunities to engage, providing a platform where communities  can engage with us, having a true plan, shared decision-making on improving  diversity and clinical trials, having those opportunities to, as sponsors, to  come in with, I want to listen, I want to understand, I want to meet you where  you're at, and not have the expectation of you meeting me where I am at, those  are opportunities that can show some level of success in the future.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Clinical trials tend to be very burdensome to  patients. One could argue that the onus that it puts on study subjects may  disproportionately impact lower income individuals that don't have the means to  take off days from work or the flexibility. In those community advisory boards,  have you heard some practical input and advice that we can be implementing? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: There are opportunities to optimize  decentralizing clinical trials as part of a solution for communities. I think  that communities feel that they want to not just be told, here's a protocol,  but they want to be part of providing input into both the protocol or even the  design of the study. There are also opportunities to provide protocols that are  more friendly from a language perspective, and there are different efforts to  continue to simplify the language, making it more palatable for patients to be  able to understand so that they want to participate in clinical trials. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>We as an industry need to make sure we're  listening and actually taking what we're hearing and implement these changes. I  think it's absolutely critical to help expand and drive the participation of  more diverse and underrepresented populations in our trials. It simply has to  just be easier for them to participate. </p>
                <p>One area that we haven't touched on yet is the FDA and the role  that they're playing. They've become quite vocal around the need to increase  diversity in trials. They've created a diversity in clinical trials initiative  that's aimed at some of the things you were mentioning about public education  to address some of the barriers preventing diverse groups from participating in  clinical trials. Recently they released a draft guidance that recommends  sponsors submit what's called a race and ethnicity diversity plan to the agency  pretty early on in clinical development. And they provided a framework that's  outlined within the in the guidance. I think it's fair to say that's also  helping to focus sponsors across the industry on ensuring that robust plans are  in place. Have those been helpful in in stimulating some of those  efforts across the industry? </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: I would say absolutely, Rob. The FDA's most  recent updates and efforts is really providing teeth for all of us to move the  needle on this topic. Here at Amgen, we've had the opportunity to help our  clinical trial program leads and teams with the diversity plans that are being  requested. The regulatory piece provides us with more strength to ensure that  this time around, we really, really make a change. I welcome all the efforts  that we're hearing from other industry bodies who are working to change the  landscape and ensure that we have better representation of underrepresented  groups.</strong>                </p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Ponda, it's clear we have our work cut out for  us. But this is quite simply something that it needs to be improved and having  somebody like you who is not only thoughtful about the approach, but really  passionate about it certainly gives me tremendous hope. It's been a real  pleasure chatting with you today. </p>
                <p><strong>Ponda: Thank you, Rob. </strong></p>

                <p><strong>Episode 4: Real-World Clinical Trial Design  and Execution in Oncology</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The  Scientist: </strong> Welcome to Innovating  Clinical Trials Clinical Trials, a special edition podcast series produced by <em>The  Scientist's</em> Creative Services Team.</p>
                <p>This  series is brought to you by Amgen, a pioneer in the science of using living  cells to make biologic medicines. They helped invent the processes and tools  that built the global biotech industry and have since reached millions of  patients suffering from serious illnesses around the world with their  medicines. </p>
                <p>Clinical trials are desperate for  innovation. Speed and efficiency need to improve as many patients cannot wait over  a decade for new, potentially lifesaving medicines, and trial participants  often do not reflect the patient population. Because clinical trials are  complex and multidisciplinary, there is not a single, simple solution for  accelerating progress. In this series, Rob Lenz, senior vice president of  Global Development at Amgen, explores the latest approaches in clinical trial  design and execution and highlights real-world examples of how scientists can  run trials better and faster to develop optimal medicines that benefit  patients.</p>
                <p><strong>Rob:</strong> Cancer is one therapeutic area where patients cannot  wait the conventional 10 or 12 years for a new therapy. For these patients,  time is of the essence and improved access to faster clinical trials can be the  difference between having a new potentially life-saving medicine available and  it being too late. In  this episode, I talk to David Raben, vice president of Global Development  Oncology at Amgen, about the next generation of oncology trial design and  execution.<strong>  </strong> </p>
                <p>The last decade witnessed tremendous innovations happening across  the clinical trial space, and it's often the case that oncology trials are on  the leading edge. Given the imminent lethality of a number of cancers, there's  a strong driver to innovate in oncology, and not just in the basic biologic  mechanisms underlying cancer, but also innovating how we develop medicines. So,  it really seems like a great time to be in oncology drug development. Dave,  you're right in the thick of that. You've had a rich and varied career. You're  a radiation oncologist, you're a translational scientist, and now you're in  oncology drug development. How does your collective experiences impact the way  that you think about innovating clinical trials for cancer patients? </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: Well, Rob, first of all, thank you so much for having me and thank you  for asking about my career because it is different. You don't normally see  radiation oncologists coming into the pharmaceutical industries. My career and  my curiosity were stimulated as a young man watching my father treat cancer  patients. He was the chair of Radiation Oncology at Wake Forest. I have an  identical twin brother, Adam Raben, and both of us decided to explore the field  of radiation oncology because, honestly, we had never met a doctor like my dad  who simply couldn't wait to get to work every day. As we got into medical  school, we initially were thinking about being surgeons and ended up wanting to  follow in his footsteps. I ended up training at Johns Hopkins Hospital, my twin  brother trained at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. While at Hopkins, my  translational curiosity really blossomed when I started to hear about this  epidermal growth factor expression signaling on cancer cells, the emerging  science around TP53 mutations. It really intrigued me, the possibilities of  using biology to enhance radiation in patients with locally advanced cancers  like head and neck cancer. When I finished up residency, I joined the faculty  at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in part because they were offering  me a chance to delve into the EGFR story where we could look at a drug called  Cetuximab, which was an anti-EGFR antibody. We conducted the first in human  phase one which led directly to a phase three study, improving local control  and survival using Cetuximab with radiation, and that was it for me. I knew,  Rob, that I wanted to have a career that included translational research. In  1998, I joined the faculty at the University of Colorado working alongside an  amazing mentor, Paul Bunn, an expert in lung cancer and incredible  translational oncologist, and we together explored that EGFR pathway with small  molecules that led from the bench into the clinic and phase one and two trials.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>With you, your brother, and your father all being  in radiation oncology, there's clearly a genetic element underlying your  interest in cancer. That's a great segue to start contemplating things like the  genetics underlying cancer. One of the greatest advances in oncology drug  development and clinical care has been the progress in precision approaches  enabled by rapid advances in understanding the underlying biology, including  cancer genetics. That then allows us to incorporate those basic understandings  into the clinical trials. Enabling things like precision medicine, where  patients are selected for targeted therapy based on the somatic mutations that  they harbor in their tumor. In your perspective, how much progress has been  made in that precision medicine approach in oncology in comparison to five to  10 years ago, in terms of clinical trials? </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: When I was training at Hopkins, we didn't really think that we could have  a patient-centric or a niche cancer approach to things, but when we think about  what we have in the arsenal now, it's outstanding to see where we've come over  the last five to 10 years. A majority of the medications that have been  approved in the last five years have been precision-based drugs. Some of these  drugs are not only hitting the primary target, but they're hitting the  resistant areas as well, allowing patients to stay on these drugs longer. We  know that monotherapy is not the end all be all, and certainly not in advanced  disease. Many of these cancers are going to develop resistant mechanisms. It's an  exciting time to utilize precision medicine to amplify immune-modifying drugs,  as well as to create long-lasting systemic benefit.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the key enablers of precision medicine  and oncology has been the ability to biopsy tumors and assess for the somatic  mutations that can direct the therapy. Not all tumors are easily biopsied. The  molecular profile the tumor can change over time with therapy. New driver  mutations can occur over time, often requiring re-biopsy, and that presents  practical challenges and potential risks to the patient. One area of promising  research involves the ability to detect circulating tumor DNA in blood, also  referred to as ctDNA, which removes the need for invasive tissue biopsies. What  promise do you see in the use of ctDNA as it relates to drug development, and  what are some of the technical limitations? </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: There are so many different ways we can approach using ctDNA, or  circulating tumor DNA-based assays. They're under considerable scrutiny now by  the FDA. And the FDA brought out that first white paper on how we should be  thinking about ctDNA and how we're going to need to get comprehensive data in  many patients to be able to say with conviction that this is going to be an  important part of how we analyze patient response to therapies and perhaps lead  to more accelerated approvals. And utilize this not just in advanced disease,  but in earlier stage disease. So, I think the assays are going to continue to  improve from sensitivity and specificity because you do get a lot of background  noise and the issues around false positives, false negatives can really impact  how our clinical trial designs may be effective or not. But I think this is  going to be an amazing thing to quickly determine response. What an amazing  thing to select which patient is going to benefit from which drugs, to get  feedback much earlier in patients with earlier stage disease rather than  waiting seven to 10 years for outcomes.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Another area, Dave, where oncology trials are  leading the way is with innovative designs. We're seeing significant increases  in the use of things like basket trials, umbrella trials. Maybe you can provide  an overview of those and what the differences are, and how you've seen them  applied best to date.</p>
                <p><strong>Dave: Let's clarify basket trials, which refer to trial designs in which a  targeted therapy is evaluated across multiple diseases that have common  alterations. These trials are typically not randomized, are typically more  exploratory, and a median size of maybe around 200 patients. Many in the past  five years investigated only a single agent, so maybe not so efficient, and a majority  of these trials are typically done in the US. You'll see some in the UK as  well, but they're not as broadly used, certainly not in underserved areas.  Umbrella trials, on the other hand, are also generally exploratory. They have  had randomized arms. They look to evaluate multiple targeted therapies for a  single disease that is typically stratified into different subgroups because  that single disease has different parts. The median number of interventions is  typically around four or five, and the median sample size is typically a little  bit larger than the basket trials, around 350 patients. Platform trials is  very, very popular now, continues to explode. It's typically randomized phase  three studies. So, there's many more patients and the durations can last a lot  longer in terms of therapy. You're talking about 700 or 800 patients here. What  I like about platform trials is its flexibility. It can add in more arms and  its ability to drop in effective arms. We're seeing a massive uptake in these  kinds of trials, and I can see this accelerating now to look at combinatorial  approaches of cancer drugs. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>So, what's the point of these trial designs? I  think it's because we're seeing cancer becoming so much more fragmented; we're  discovering new mutations, it's unrealistic to use old school conventional  trial designs to interrogate genomic-based cancer mutations. There's the  Morpheus trial that that looks at very, very small, randomized registrational  trials in specific areas, like patients who have failed immunotherapy, to  quickly interrogate in an umbrella fashion. As mentioned earlier, the  opportunity to quickly look from a biomarker-based perspective whether patients  are responding to the standard of care plus drug A, or drug B, or drug C. But  even more interesting to me is the ability to potentially do this at an earlier  stage of cancer. A person once told me the best type of cancer to cure is the  one you can't see rather than the one you can see. And so molecular profiling  and these types of platform studies have moved into earlier stage settings  where now we're talking about truly changing the course of a patient's life. We  have trials looking prospectively at ctDNA to determine the optimal routes of  therapy, and this could provide huge advantages for patients to know quickly if  a therapy is actually working before we see that gross failure by imaging. This  is for many companies, for academicians, for even community-based centers to  test out new drugs rapidly here. We as drug developers need to be thinking more  broadly about how we drug develop in parallel going after earlier stage  cancers, as well as late-stage cancers, because those patients have different  setups, different tumor burdens, different immune microenvironments. So, I  personally like the thought of using biomarker-driven basket and umbrella  trials to test out novel combinations because there's going to be so many  patients who develop resistance to mono therapy-based approaches. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>You clearly articulated that one of the major  drivers of these various innovative trial designs is speed, efficiency. There's  really no other area where speed is more important than in oncology, where the  unmet need is so huge, but we also know that only about 5% of patients with  cancer actually participate in a clinical trial. There are numerous barriers,  like overly complex protocols, lack of having conveniently-located trial sites.  What are some of the other areas that are having an impact in accelerating  clinical trials, in broadening that aperture so that more patients can participate? </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: Decentralized trials is one way to think about bringing the trial to the  patient. It's certainly an area of intense interest within the FDA, within  patient advocacy groups, major cancer organizations. Correct me if I'm wrong  here, just about everyone in this world lives within about 30 minutes of a  Starbucks, yet they have to drive hours and hours to get to a major cancer  center. Now there's many decentralized trials that are expanding in the US that  offer greater inclusivity. They can help identify rare patients by connecting a  local oncologist to the study investigator. They can utilize third party  vendors that can facilitate these key connections between mobile nursing  research coordinators, get them genomic testing, wearable devices for real time  patient monitoring coupled with telemedicine, all to really improve the patient  experience. The data actually seems to show that patients who go into clinical  trials have better outcomes in general because their monitoring follows so  carefully. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Another interesting area is this concept around  time toxicity. It's the time spent in coordinating care for the patient, the  travels to the clinics, undergoing multiple tests, all for a modest gain in  survival in many instances. The amount of time spent receiving cancer care can  be really substantial. So, can we use decentralized trials as an example to  reduce this burden here? And then, that gets back to the complexity of trials.  We've got to find ways to reduce clinical trial complexity—the patient advocacy  groups are demanding this. When we look at our inclusion and exclusion  criteria, some of it is so outdated. How do we reduce requirements? How do we  reduce the need for unnecessary tissue biopsies? How do we reduce the need to  visit clinics? How do we improve data collection methods and requirements to  facilitate a patient actually wanting to go on to a clinical trial, or in the  investigators actually wanting to open that trial? As it goes around to the  platform-based approaches that you were mentioning, can we again look at this  as a way to do tumor agnostic approaches, utilize ctDNA as an example here, and  streamline many of our trial designs, making them much leaner? We have a lot  less patients going into these trials because they're much more focused and specific.  It's really a coordinated approach with intense dialogue with our FDA partners  and our patient advocacy groups to get us more clarified and simplified trial  designs that are going to be much more cost effective and impactful for the  patient. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>So, Dave, this point of reduced complexity is  absolutely critical. Unfortunately, I think all industry trends are heading in  the opposite direction. There's a fair amount of data showing that the  complexity of our trials is not going down, but it's going up. One of the areas  that that gives me enthusiasm is how do we more fully utilize the existing data  sources that we have. We have unprecedented access now to various real world  data sets to do things like help us understand what the implications are of our  inclusion/exclusion criteria is on a population. So, appreciating what  the implications are in restricting a large portion of that patient population.  We can now use that real world data and make those trade-offs and understand  what those are in real time as we're designing the study and putting in place  an operationally feasible protocol. And the other area is using those real-world  data sources to identify where those patients are, because to your point, the  majority of them do not live within 30 minutes of investigative site, right?  How can we employ the decentralized trial toolkit to reach out to those  patients once they've been identified in an anonymized way and relieve them of  the burden of having to come all the way in to a brick and mortar clinical  trial site? So, Dave, as you look into your crystal ball, what do you see as  important future directions and trends and oncology clinical trials? </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: I'm really excited about how we're going into earlier stages of cancer in  a parallel drug development approach. We want to detect cancers, treat cancers  when they're way earlier because we know that's where the real bang for the  buck comes. I'm excited about combinatorial approaches because cancers are not  going to be solved by typical monotherapy approaches; they're just too clever.  They're resilient, they're rebellious, and they can get around roadblocks. I  see us continuing to customize our patients here. So, I'm really excited about  ctDNA, to understand from a longitudinal perspective how patients might benefit  from our drugs and quickly get away from drugs that are not working. That's a  game changer for patients. So, I see all these things evolving over the next  five years in a very robust fashion.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Well, there's no doubt that the pace of biologic  insights and oncology has accelerated, and I think the key is going to be for  those of us on the clinical trial side to ensure that the clinical trial  methodology, the advances, the operational considerations to allow  interrogation, precision medicine, combinatorial approaches keep pace with  those biologic insights. </p>
                <p><strong>Dave: Absolutely, and I just can't wait to see how things are going to evolve. Thank  you so much.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rob: </strong>Dave, thanks for joining me today. I really  enjoyed the conversation. I'll say I feel even more optimistic about oncology  clinical development than I did before our discussion today. So, thank you. </p>
